As far as this code is copyright 19??-1995 Matthias Urlichs,
as of 2022-02 I hereby relicense it under the GPL v2 or later.

If you don't know where to find the text of the GPL v2, please delete this
archive and do something useful instead.

You might (or might not) want to take the first three words of this file
seriously. There's a "streams" subdirectory in there, and if you know
anything about the history of Unix you should notice the problem.

That being said, the code is too old to be useful with modern compilers
and the copyright holder doesn't exist any more anyway (more or less), so
I'll leave deciding whether or not that's a possible problem to the reader/user.

Personally, I wouldn't bother.

In case anybody knows the "Brad K. Clements" who wrote the code that ended up
as isdn/str_if/str_in.c in 1990: please forward his email address to me.
I'd like to ask him whether we should still take his "all rights reserved"
seriously.
